1.2 SDL GAME 
# Adventure and Culture Game: A Journey Through Tunisian History 👋

Welcome to my SDL 1.2 game, an adventure and culture game that takes you on a journey through Tunisian history, with a special focus on the Roman Empire.

## About the Game 🎮

The game features a principal character named Sam, a warrior who battles monsters and wins. The game is not just about fighting; it's also about learning. Sam has to play a quiz game about Tunisian history, a tic-tac-toe game, and a puzzle game to pass to other levels.

## Technologies Used 💻

The game is developed using the SDL 1.2 library and written in the C programming language.

## Project Background 📚

This project was created by me, Ahmed Rayen Bouazizi, as part of my school project at ESPRIT University in the 2022-2023 academic year. I would like to express my gratitude to my teachers and ESPRIT for providing us with opportunities to be creative and innovative.
